# Projectile Motion

This project will be able to calculate values that determine the focus of an object's
trajectory, whether it is horizontally launched, or follows a symmetrical nature through
an angled launch.

# Versions

This is my first attempt at this project, so don't expect this to be anything near complete.
I'm always open for others to collaborate with me, or to give me some pointers on how to make
my code as concise and logically sound as possible. I'm motivated to add as many edits as necessary
to better this program. Thanks!
